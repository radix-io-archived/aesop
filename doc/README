The files in this directory contain documentation in asciidoc
format.

To convert all documents from .txt asciidoc files to pdf format, run "make
docs" from the top level build directory.

To convert a document from .txt to html format, then run "make doc/foo.html"
where foo is the name of the document that you want to convert.

Some asciidoc files included embedded figures in ditta or graphviz
format.  The graphviz package must be installed on your build system in 
order to generate the graphviz figures. 

See http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/ for documenation on the asciidoc
syntax.  The "Cheatsheet" link is especially helpful.
