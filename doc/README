The files in this directory contain documentation in asciidoc
format.

Some asciidoc files included embedded figures in ditta or graphviz
format.  The graphviz package must be installed on your build system in 
order to generate the graphviz figures. 

See http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/ for documenation on the asciidoc
syntax.  The "Cheatsheet" link is especially helpful.
