Aesop
=====

== Source files

Aesop source and header files are named *.ae and *.hae, respectively.  They
are used exactly like c source and header files, except that they support
additional constructs, such as the __blocking qualifier for functions and
the pwait and pbranch constructs.

In addition, Aesop remote code (ie, RPC functions) can be found in .aer and
.haer functions.  These source files support an additional __remote
qualifier for functions to be invoked via RPC.

== Compilers

The configure process produces two compilers in the maint/ directory.  aecc
is a compiler for .ae files, and aercc is a compiler for .aer files.  Both
are shell scripts that combine preprocessing, source translation, and
compilation into one step.

== Resources

Resources are the lowest level aesop components that present Aesop
compatible intefaces for managing concurrency.   An example is the timer
resource, found in aesop/resource/timer.  It implements timers with
millisecond resolution.  The underlying implementation uses libev.

== Test programs

A variety of tests and/or examples for Aesop functionality can be found in
the aesop/parser/tests/blocking directory.  These tests use a
dummy resource to demonstrate various language features.
