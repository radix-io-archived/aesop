If you want to build/install haskell and
the necessary haskell libraries for aesop, you should follow these steps:

On debian/ubuntu, run (requires sudo privs):

./maint/hs/setup-hs-debian
./maint/hs/setup-langc

If you don't have root, but haskell (ghc) has already been installed, you can do:

./maint/hs/setup-hs-local
./maint/hs/setup-langc

On systems without haskell binary packages (ghc), you'll need to do:

* Download/Build/Install ghc from http://www.haskell.org/ghc/
* Download/Build/Install MTL from http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/mtl
* Download/Build/Install happy from http://www.haskell.org/happy/
* Download/Build/Install alex from http://www.haskell.org/alex/

* Then run: setup-langc

NOTE: Building by hand turns out to be a big PITA, its highly recommended
that you find a system where you can install the debian packages.
