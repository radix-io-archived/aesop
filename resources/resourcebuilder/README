Possible things that will be needed:
- Access to the config array. Can easily be exposed through rb API
- Option to provide a poll function.
- Stateful cancel support
    - Since aesop decides to cancel, there might be a race between
    the resource (completing the call) and the capture_slot call.  Meaning the
    user of RB has to check after returning from the capture_slot call if the
    call really was cancelled or not.
